#  Quote App | Code Refresher App

Quick Quote App using a free quote api. Practicing my TypeScript, End to end/Unit testing, hooks(Mocha Chai, React Testing Library), and Array Functions. Note to self: This is potentially a good candiate to share with others trying to learn these concepts from a basic example.
Libraries: Axios, react-testing-library, jest, mocha/chai

Instructions:
1. Fork and clone this project so you can connect it to your local enviornment
2. run npm i && npm start
3. Test app out to find quotes and reference the code 

UI/Api
Done:
- Start basic app
- Make super simple ui to seperate out header vs main screen
- Seperate out Css styling files
- Make cards for fake quote data before using real api calls. 
- Make header a simple search bar and icon that functions. 
Todo: 
- Slight cleanup/making code reusable 
- Use Real api calls and adjust typescript typing if needed
- Probably some slight cleanup needed after
- Add loading animation
- Add User login page if ready
- 
Testing
Todo:
- Unit test for search bar 
- Unit test for card
- End to end on both of them working
