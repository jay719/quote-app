#  Quote App | Code Refresher App

Quick Quote App using a free quote api. Practicing my TypeScript, End to end/Unit testing, hooks(Mocha Chai, React Testing Library), and Array Functions. Note to self: This is potentially a good candiate to share with others trying to learn these concepts from a basic example.

Instructions:
1. Fork and clone this project so you can connect it to your local enviornment
2. run npm i && npm start
3. Test app out and reference the code 

Done:
- Start basic app
- Make super simple ui to seperate out header vs main screen
- Seperate out Css styling
- Make cards for fake quote data before using real api calls. 
- Make header a simple search bar and icon that functions. 

Todo: 
- Slight cleanup/making code reusable 
- Use Real api calls and adjust typescript typing if needed
- Probably some slight cleanup needed after
- Add loading animation
- Add User login page if ready
